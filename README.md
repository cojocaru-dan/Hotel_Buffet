# Ehotel-Buffet
### In this project, we create a hotel application. The idea is to automate as much as we can the operation workflow. As a start, we create a buffet simulator that helps us to develop and optimize the logic behind how to run the buffet effectively. The buffet management module gets information from the guest reservation module about current and future guests, and tries to achieve two goals:
### 1.	Minimize guests dissatisfaction by avoiding empty plates in the buffet.
### 2.	Minimize food waste.

### These goals pull in different directions, and a balance is hard to find as the exact demand is not predictable, but we can rely on all the data available before the guests eventually show up in the restaurant.


### our application should:
### •	satisfy the Single Responsibility Principle
### •	use the Interface Segregation Principle
### •	use Dependency Injection
### •	include logging of the operations
### •	follow Clean Code Principles

### we will learn organizing complex application and simulating a complex flow of events.

### we are going to use: collections, dates, records, enums.
